# NDNts Personal CA environment variables
# Copy sample.env to .env then start the program.
# Note that the program may overwrite .env file, and comments will disappear.

# How to connect to NDN testbed.
#   "autoconfig:" uses NDN-FCH service.
#   "tcp://192.0.2.1:6363" connects to a specific router.
#   UDP is not recommended because NDNts doesn't support NDNLPv2 fragmentation-reassembly.
#   Unix socket to local NFD won't work because Personal CA needs to register prefixes on testbed.
NDNTS_UPLINK=autoconfig:

# Enabling NFD registration commands.
# This option must be set.
# @ndn/cli-common picks up these options.

# 2. Access http://localhost:8722 on the client side.
